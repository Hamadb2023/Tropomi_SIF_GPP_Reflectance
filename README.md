# Tropomi_SIF_GPP_Reflectance
TROPO_SIF, MODIS spectral reflectance and groud-based GPP  over 40 Integrated Carbone Observatory Systems sites.
This repository includes codes and data from studying the relationship betweem SIF and GPP and modelling GPP from MODIS spectral reflectance, 
vegetation indices and TROPOMI SIF from Caltech dataset using a data-driven method (Random Forest model).
